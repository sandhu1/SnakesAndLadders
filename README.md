Run main.py with other files present in project directory

# Assumptions made:
1.Both players are initially at 0,0 position and they start moving ahead as soon as first player rolls dice. <br />
2.If a players has got 6 on dice,then only 1 more turn is given to the player.<br />
3.Incase of 6 on dice,a player first moves 6 steps and can lead to snake bite or ladder climb.Thereafter second turn is provided.<br />
4.Snakes lead to decrease in position and Ladders lead to increase in position.<br />
5.A player wins only when it reaches exactly 100th position.eg If a player is on 98 and gets 3 on dice,then he needs 2 for winning and will try so in next turn.<br />
